# Sequential Triangle Test in Sensory Evaluation

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **sequential test** using R, following the methodology described in *Sensory Evaluation Techniques* (Meilgaard et al., 2015). The sequential approach allows for early decision-making in sensory discrimination testing by evaluating the cumulative correct responses against pre-defined decision boundaries.

## 🔍 Overview

The triangle test is a common sensory method to determine whether a perceptible difference exists between two products. The sequential version of this test is more efficient, as it allows the test to stop as soon as enough evidence is gathered—saving time, panelist fatigue, and resources.

This project includes:
- Explanation of the sequential test logic
- Custom R functions to calculate decision boundaries
- Examples using both simulated and user-defined data
- Visualization of test progress and decisions

## 📈 Features

- Specify your own values for:
  - `alpha`: probability of type I error (false positive)
  - `beta`: probability of type II error (false negative)
  - `p0`: guessing probability (e.g., 1/3 for triangle test)
  - `p1`: expected correct proportion under alternative hypothesis
- Use simulated responses or your own test data
- Automatically compute upper and lower
